# Programming 1

## What you'll learn

The course will help you develop an appreciation for programming as a problem 
solving tool. You'll learn how to think algorithmically and solve problems 
efficiently, and serves as the foundation for further computer science studies. 

Using a project-based approach, you'll learn to manipulate variables, 
expressions, and statements in Python, and use functions and loops to solve more
complicated problems. 

With the basics in hand, you will dive deep into data structures such as strings, 
files, lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Over the course of the term, you will 
learn the properties of these fundamental data structures, and how to reason
about using them in algorithms.

Throughout the course, you will be exposed to _abstraction_ and will learn a 
systematic way of breaking down problems to construct solutions. 

You aren't on this journey alone. You'll work on team projects, practice pair 
programming, perform code reviews, and use other collaboration methods common to 
the tech industry. 

The course culminates in a final group project, where you'll get to demonstrate
all that you've learned, and make something creative.
