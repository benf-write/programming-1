## What you'll learn

The course will help you develop an appreciation for programming as a problem
solving tool. You'll learn how to think algorithmically and solve problems
efficiently, and serves as the foundation for further computer science studies.

Using a project-based approach, you'll learn to manipulate variables,
expressions, and statements in Python, and use functions and loops to solve more
complicated problems.

With the basics in hand, you will dive deep into data structures such as strings,
files, lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Over the course of the term, you will
learn the properties of these fundamental data structures, and how to reason
about using them in algorithms.

Throughout the course, you will be exposed to _abstraction_ and will learn a
systematic way of breaking down problems to construct solutions.

You aren't on this journey alone. You'll work on team projects, practice pair
programming, perform code reviews, and use other collaboration methods common to
the tech industry.

The course culminates in a final group project, where you'll get to demonstrate
all that you've learned, and make something creative.

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

* Read and engage with the materials on this site
* Attend live class and complete the activities in class
* Practice with exercises to try out the concepts
* Complete projects to demonstrate what you have learned

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try to
write lots of programs, so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of
ways.

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice problems outside of the
practice problems included in the course.

## Assessments

Your overall course grade is made up of:

- Weekly assignments: 50%
- Midterm Project: 25%
- Final Project: 25%

* **Weekly Assignments**: Each week, you will have several ungraded exercises
  to practice the concepts you learned that week. You will also have a
  _project_, a substantive graded program to write. There are 6 projects in
  total, each worth 10% of your final grade.
* **Midterm and Final Project**: You will have two larger projects, midway
  through the course and at the end of the course, reflecting all that you've
  learned up to that point. Each contributes 25% of your final grade.

More details about your assignments are given on the next few pages.

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

* **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
* **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github. 
* **VSCode** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve
    programming assignments. It also has an embedded terminal, where you can run
    Python to try out your code and test that it works.
* **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
    submissions and give you feedback on your work.
* **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
    you get credit towards your degree.
