# Project

**Due date: Nov 28**

ðŸ’¡ This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-prog1** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

## Directory Maintainer

In this project, you will help the data team of your engineering firm
automate categorizing and moving files within a messy directory.

You'll practice lots of filesystem manipulation.
