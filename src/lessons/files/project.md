# Project

**Due date: Nov 28**

ðŸ’¡ This is team project, you can work with a partner. Plaese make sure to team up with a partner ahead of time. You both need to join the same Github Classroom team. Make sure that both of your names are associated with the submission in Gradescope.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-prog1** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

## Directory Maintainer

In this project, you will help the data team of your engineering firm
automate categorizing and moving files within a messy directory.

You'll practice lots of filesystem manipulation.

## How should you work together?

You need to communicate about work splitting and areas of responsibility. You will implement a function with small features, try to communicate who is responsible for which feature.

For instance, each student can take more responsibility to support a specific feature within code:

- Team member 1: Size threshold feature
- Team member 2: Log windows feature

If you are working by pair programming, make sure to switch roles between code snippets so each of you get the chance to write and review code.

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord
