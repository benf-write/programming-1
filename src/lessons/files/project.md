# Project

**Due date: Nov 28**

ðŸ’¡ This is a pair project. You can work with a partner if you choose. Communicate
with your partner ahead of time, then join the same Github Classroom team. Make 
sure that both of your names are associated with the submission in Gradescope.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the 
**#help-prog1** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil 
the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a 
screenshot or code sample.

## Directory Maintainer

In this project, you will help the data team of your engineering firm
automate categorizing and moving files within a messy directory.

You'll practice lots of filesystem manipulation.

## How should you work together?

You need to communicate about work splitting and areas of responsibility. Decide
who will be responsible for each of the features of the project.

Here's one way you might split up the work:

- Discuss the plan for the project
- Pair program on creating the destination folders and the File Categorization
- Team member 1: implement the Log Retention feature
- Team member 2: implement the Large Files size threshold feature
- Both: test that the code works as expected

When you are pair programming, make sure to switch roles so each of you get the 
chance to write and review code. Both of you need to know how all the code
works in your project, even for the parts you did not write.
