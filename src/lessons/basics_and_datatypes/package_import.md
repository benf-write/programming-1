# Importing Packages

As the course moves on, you'll write more and more complicated programs. So far,
each program has been made of just one file. Python allows you to split code
into different files, and then use functions from a different file in your code.

To use a function from another file, you'll use the `import` keyword.

Here's an example:

```python
# import 
import random

# print a random int between 1 and 100
print(random.randint(1,100))
```

This code imports the `random.randint` function to generate random numbers.

In the practice exercise on Decryption and again in the Bonus task for the week
1 project, you'll get a chance to see `import` in action. You'll learn more
about functions, files, and packages later on in the course.
