# Project

**Due date: Oct 17**

> ðŸ‘¥ This is a team project. Find a teammate (or two teammates, for a maximum of three students per team) from your squad, and schedule time to work on the project together.

> You can work together by sharing your screen, or by joining a team project on
> Replit. Be sure that everyone on the team submits the project, for credit.
