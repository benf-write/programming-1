# Asking for Help

When you have a problem or get stuck on an exercise, you should ask for help.

* Use the #help-prog1 channel in Discord
* Be specific about what you are confused by
* Include a snippet of code, or a screenshot or link to an example

## Peer collaboration

You can work with your peers on exercises, and on some of the projects, as
specified in the project instructions.

When you work with a peer, be sure that you:

* Collaborate effectively: communicate with your peers about when you will meet
    and what you will do
* Write code yourself: do not just watch someone else solve the problem. You
    have to write lots of code in this course in order to succeed.
* Read and understand your peers' code: seeing how someone else solves a problem
    can help you learn new techniques, or you might have a better technique to
    share with your partner. If there's something in their code you are confused
    by, _ask_
