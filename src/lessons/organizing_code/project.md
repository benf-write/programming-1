# Project

**Due date: Nov 21**

> ðŸ’¡ This is a pair project. You can work with a partner. Please communicate
> with your partner ahead of time, then join the same Github classroom team.
> Make sure that both of your names are associated with the submission in
> Gradescope.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-prog1** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

## Microprocessor Simulation

The microprocessor is the chip at the heart of every computer. Inside the
microprocessor is an _Arithmetic Logic Unit_ (ALU) that performs very simple
operations on numbers.

In this project, you will write a program that simulates a bit of what a
microprocessor does. You'll use lots of helper functions. Since your program
will be larger than the programs you've written before, you'll have to think
carefully about how you organize your code, and how it works together.

## How should you work together?

This is a larger project than most of the exercises you've done so far, so you 
should communicate about the design of the solution and how you will split up
the work. 

There are 8 functions in the assignment, and you should each implement 4 of 
them. One fair split would be:

* Team member 1: noop, add, mul,gt,nand
* Team member 2: sub, min, or, shift, invalid

If you work at the same time over videochat, be sure that each person gets to do
about half of the typing. You should switch off every 20 minutes or so, so that
both of you get the chance to practice.

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord
