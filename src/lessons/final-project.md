## Population Analysis

This project will be a data analysis problem. You'll use what you've
learned so far to understand a population dataset, and have a chance to
creatively explore in other directions.

More details about the final project will be shared later on.

This is a chance to be creative with the new skills you've learned.

In this project, you will be guided through an initial analysis of population
data using all the concepts you've learned in the course. Once you've completed
the initial analysis, you can choose what other analysis or features you'd like
to add to the project.

## Tic Tac Toe Game

In this project, you will build a fully functional tic-tac-toe game. Tic-tac-toe, or Xs and Os is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord

## Presentations

In the last week, you'll schedule a time to present your work. You'll show the
output of your application, and answer some questions about how the code works.

It will be a fun time to see what your classmates have come up with, as well as
a chance to show off what you've made.
